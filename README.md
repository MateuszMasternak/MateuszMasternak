## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Home Budget Tracker](https://home-budget-tracker.vercel.app/). This is a Java-based API designed to help users manage their personal finances. It offers features like tracking income and expenses, categorizing transactions, generating CSV reports, calculating balances, filtering by date or category, and retrieving exchange rates. The application supports JWT authentication via AWS Cognito, integrates with AWS S3 and CloudFront for image storage and delivery, and is deployed on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database. Docker configuration and Swagger documentation are included. Additionally, I am working on a simple frontend to complement the API.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Spring ecosystem, AWS and trying to get into frontend also learning TypeScript and React.
