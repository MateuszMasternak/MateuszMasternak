## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Home Budget Tracker](https://home-budget-tracker.vercel.app/) - a Java-based API designed to help users manage their personal finances. It includes features such as income and expense tracking, transaction categorization, CSV report generation, balance calculations, date/category filtering, and real-time exchange rate retrieval. The application uses JWT authentication via AWS Cognito, integrates with AWS S3 and CloudFront for image storage and delivery, and is deployed on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database. It also includes Docker support and Swagger documentation. Additionally, Iâ€™m developing a simple frontend to complement the API.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Java, the Spring ecosystem, AWS**, and expanding into frontend development with **TypeScript** and **React**.
